# FotoNegative

# Why? / Scope
FotoNegative is a web application targeting on photographers and hobbyists, where it allows users to views different types of camera from film to digital and view sample images from that camera. I wanted to build a web application that gathers photography lovers and create a community that shares their photos and the camera gear they are using. This allow other users see sample images from a specific camera they are interested in owning/purchasing. 

# User Stories
Homepage of the FotoNegative shows various types of cameras and categories. Non-members can surf around the website and views specific camera and view sample images from different users who posted a comments/ pictures. 

Cameras can be filtered by film or digital and its categories. 

Non-members can sign up for an account by clicking the SIGNUP link on the top of the web page. Once signed-up, new members can make comments, post images, edit and delete their comments. New members and existing members can view their profile page and update their profile.
